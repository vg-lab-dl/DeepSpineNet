# DeepSpineNet
This repository contains the code used for the deep learning part of our work. We developed our models and our training/testing environment using TensorFlow.

## Installation
Requires **Python 3.6.8 or later** and **CUDA 10.1** (to enable the use of GPUs, it can be used without CUDA, on CPU, with longer training/testing times.).
1. Download the current project:
   > git clone https://github.com/vg-lab-dl/DeepSpineNet.git
2. Install dependencies (from the root directory of the project):
   > pip install -r requirements.txt.

## Example of data used during training
You can download an example of data used to train our models from: https://bit.ly/3LSPtlQ

## Usage
For reproducibility purposes, we provide the configuration files ([M1.yaml](config_files/M1.yaml), [M2.yaml](config_files/M2.yaml) and [M3.yaml](config_files/M3.yaml)) used for the models described in our work. These files are in the [config_files](config_files) folder and can be used with the below instructions. 
### Training
To train a model, use the following command:
> python main.py -p=train -cf=config.yaml

### Testing
To test a model, use the following command:
> python main.py -p=test -cf=config.yaml
